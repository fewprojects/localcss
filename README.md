If you didn't like any of pre-built themes, you can create a new theme with different color palette and typography.

You can do that in less than 2 minutes, let's see how!

Follow these steps to create a new theme for your project

- Create a new css file **YourTheme.css** (You can name it anything)

- Copy this following code into your new css file

```css
/* Import your favourite font family */
@import url(" ");

:root {
  /* For Buttons, Inputs & Hyperlinks */
  --primary-color: #8b51f7 !important;
  --accent-color: #7938f1 !important;

  /* For Headings & Text */
  --heading-color: #f1f1f1 !important;
  --body-text-color: #dedede !important;

  /* For Background and Containers */
  --background-color: #000000 !important;
  --container-color: #121212 !important;

  /*Font Family */
  --font-family: "Public Sans", sans-serif !important;
}
```

- Replace the default variables with your color palette and font-family (Do not remove '!important' tag).

- Add this 'YourTheme.css' into <head></head> tag of your HTML document.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="YourTheme.css" />
```

and voila!

You just created a new theme for your project ðŸŽ‰
